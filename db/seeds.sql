/*
 GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

the first thing you want to do is make sure you are creating a database correctly using the schema.sql file
4:04
after creating your database and sourcing it, you will need to seed the database correctly using a seed.sql file
4:05
once your database is seeded correctly the next thing to do would be to create a mysql connection
4:05
if set up correctly it will allow you to correctly connect to your newly created database
4:05
once you have the connection set up you can then start working on the prompts
4:06
I think this would be a good path forward to take as each of these steps are essential in having your app function correctly
4:06
a good reference would be your module's miniproject
4:06
it shows the best practices when creating your project's folder and file setup
4:07
as well as the syntax needed to create a database and seed it
